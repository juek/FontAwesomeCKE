# FontAwesomeCKE - FontAwesome icon support for CKEditor in Typesetter CMS #

## About
Adds full support for Typesetter&rsquo;s bundled <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/" target="_blank">FontAwesome 4.7 icon font</a> to CK Editor (current CKE version 4.5).

* FontAwesomeCKE is a successor of the older [FontAwesome](https://www.typesettercms.com/Plugins/274_FontAwesome) plugin which only supported FontAwesome up to ver 4.3
* This version does not include the FontAwesome fonts and css but uses Typesetter&rsquo;s bundled version. Therefore Typesetter CMS ver. 5+ is required, ver. 5.1+ is recommended
* After installation, a new ![Icon](/CKEditor_plugins/fontawesome-1.3/icons/fontawesome.png?raw=true) button will appear in CKEditor&rsquo;s toolbars which invokes the plugin dialog to choose from  675 FontAwesome icons
